          <h2>A Greatest Indian industrialist</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Ratan Naval Tata (born 28 December 1937) is an Indian
              industrialist, philanthropist and former chairman of Tata Sons.</b>
              
            He was a chairman of the Tata Group from 1990 to 2012, and interim
            chairman from October 2016 through February 2017. He continues to
            head its charitable trusts.In 2008, he received the Padma Vibhushan,
            the second highest civilian honour in India, after receiving the
            Padma Bhushan, the third highest civilian honour in 2000.
            <br />

            He is the son of Naval Tata, who was adopted by Ratanji Tata, son of
            Jamsetji Tata, the founder of the Tata Group. He graduated from the
            Cornell University College of Architecture with a bachelor's degree
            in architecture. He joined Tata in 1961, where he worked on the shop
            floor of Tata Steel. He later succeeded J. R. D. Tata as chairman of
            Tata Sons upon the latter's retirement in 1991. Under his tenure the
            Tata Group acquired Tetley, Jaguar Land Rover, and Corus, in an
            attempt to turn Tata from a largely India-centric group into a
            global business. Tata is also one of the largest philanthropists in
            the world, having donated around 60-65% of his income to charity.
            <br />
            Ratan Tata is also a prolific investor and has made numerous
            investments in several startups. Tata has invested in over 30
            start-ups to date, most in a personal capacity and some via his
            investment company.
